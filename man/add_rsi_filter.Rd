\title{Add an RSI-based signal filter to a data.table}
\usage{
add_rsi_filter(
  dt,
  time_period = "1 hour",
  n = 7,
  cutoff = 30,
  column_name = "deal_start",
  rsi_is_above = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{A \code{data.table} containing 'time' and 'price' columns.}

\item{time_period}{The time frame for resampling, e.g., "1 hour", "15 minutes".}

\item{n}{The number of periods for the RSI calculation.}

\item{cutoff}{The RSI threshold.}

\item{column_name}{The name of the logical column to be created. Defaults to "deal_start".}

\item{rsi_is_above}{If \code{TRUE}, the signal is \code{TRUE} when RSI > cutoff. If \code{FALSE} (default),
the signal is \code{TRUE} when RSI < cutoff.}
}
\value{
The \code{data.table} \code{dt} is returned after being modified in place.

\description{
This function calculates the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on a resampled
time series and creates a logical column based on a cutoff. It can be used
to create \code{deal_start} signals (e.g., RSI is low, indicating oversold) or
\code{emergency_stop} signals (e.g., RSI is high, indicating overbought).

The function modifies the input \code{data.table} by reference for maximum memory
efficiency.
