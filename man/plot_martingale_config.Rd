\usage{
plot_martingale_config(
  starting_price,
  base_order_volume = 10,
  first_safety_order_volume = 10,
  n_safety_orders = 8,
  pricescale = 2.4,
  volumescale = 1.5,
  take_profit = 2.4,
  stepscale = 1,
  plot_type = c("timeline", "allocation")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{starting_price}{The initial price at which the base order would be placed.}

\item{base_order_volume}{The size of the base order (in quote currency).}

\item{first_safety_order_volume}{The size of the first safety order.}

\item{n_safety_orders}{The maximum number of safety orders.}

\item{pricescale}{Price deviation to open safety orders (\% from initial order).}

\item{volumescale}{Volume multiplier for each subsequent safety order.}

\item{take_profit}{Profit target percentage when all orders are filled.}

\item{stepscale}{Price deviation multiplier for safety orders.}

\item{plot_type}{Which plot to produce. One of \code{"timeline"} (default) or
\code{"allocation"}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing the requested visualization.
}
\description{
Visualize a martingale strategy configuration in two complementary ways:
\itemize{
\item "timeline": shows how the strategy would unfold over time as safety orders
are triggered, with purchase prices on the Y-axis and order sequence on the X-axis.
\item "allocation": shows horizontal stacked bars per price level with the dollar
amounts for newly invested capital, previously invested capital, accumulated
loss, and uninvested funds on the X-axis and price level on the Y-axis.
}

Both views display the take-profit level derived from the weighted average price
when all orders are filled.
